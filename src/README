There are 2 data structures that my server uses which used synchronization:
	buffer.h
	emails.h

buffer.h is the queue which stores clients the server recieves.
Threads take clients from this queue. This class is thread safe.

emails.h contains the map of all users and their emails.
It is a thread safe class to prevent multiple threads from editing the map simultaneously.
